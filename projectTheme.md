The Tip Tracking and Analytics for Bartenders is likely the simplest to implement. Here’s why:

Core Functionality: It requires basic CRUD operations—bartenders can log (Create) their tips, view (Read) past entries, edit (Update) entries if needed, and delete (Delete) them. This aligns well with the requirements for GET and POST routes.

Basic Data Structure: The data model is straightforward, focusing on entries for tips, dates, shifts, and possibly location or shift type (e.g., day/night).

Analytics: Basic analytics like total tips, average tips, peak hours, and simple visualizations (like graphs of weekly or monthly earnings) can be created without complex calculations or data structures.

Simple Authentication: Since it's a personal tool, you might only need basic user authentication, which is manageable with express-session and cookies.

This project has clear deliverables and could be built within the scope of a single full-stack application, meeting all requirements without overly complex data relationships or external integrations.
